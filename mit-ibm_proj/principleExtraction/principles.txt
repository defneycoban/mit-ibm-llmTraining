##Excerpt##
"And if you, my vassal, disobey or break this treaty, may the god Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, put an end to all vegetation in your land. May his waters hit your land with a severe destructive downpour. May locusts devour your crops. May there be no sound of grinding stones in your houses. May the wild animals eat your bread, and may your spirit have no one to take care of it and pour offerings of wine for it." Excerpt from a treaty between an Assyrian king and the ruler of a subject city-state in northwestern Iran, circa 670 B.C.E.

Based on the text, the particular consequences invoked in the ritual curse in the treaty most strongly support which of the following statements about ancient Mesopotamia?

(A) States legitimacy was based on claims to secular authority.
(B) Ongoing environmental degradation occurred as a byproduct of the spread of pastoralism.
(C) Maintaining and expanding agricultural production was seen as a core task of governments.
(D) The domestication of plants occurred before the domestication of animals.

##Answer##
Summary: The provided text is from a treaty between an Assyrian king and the ruler of a subject city-state in northwestern Iran, circa 670 B.C.E. It contains a warning of severe consequences if the treaty is disobeyed, including potential harm to the land and its agriculture.

Excerpt: The section most closely related to the question is: "May the god Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, put an end to all vegetation in your land. May his waters hit your land with a severe destructive downpour. May locusts devour your crops."

Analysis: The question seeks to determine which statement about ancient Mesopotamia is most strongly supported by the consequences described in the treaty. We need to consider the implications of these consequences on the society's priorities and concerns.

## Question ##

Subject: bio
Principle: Follow the following principles:
1. First analyze the question.
2. Second, Give the definition of some keywords in the question and the options
3. Give necessary background in biology when needed,
4. Do not reveal the final answer.

## Example ##
## Question ##
A dog is following the scent of a jackrabbit. Which of the following accurately describes how the dog’s brain integrates information for smell?

(A) Chemoreceptors in the brain send impulses for smell in the nasal cavity.
(B) Chemoreceptor cells in the nasal cavity send impulses to the appropriate area of the brain.
(C) Chemoreceptors on epithelial cells of the tongue send hormones to the appropriate area of the brain.
(D) Receptors originating in the nose send action potentials to the motor regions of the brain.

## Answer ##
Analysis: The question seems to be focused on understanding the mechanism by which a dog's brain processes the sense of smell. It requires a basic understanding of the sensory system involved in the detection of scent and the transmission of signals to the brain.

Definition of keywords:
Chemoreceptors: These are sensory receptors that detect chemical stimuli in the environment, such as taste and smell.
Nasal cavity: This refers to the inside of the nose, which filters, warms, and moistens air as it is inhaled.
Hormones: Chemical messengers produced by various glands in the body that regulate various functions.
Epithelial cells: These are the cells that form the surface of the skin and line the cavities and surfaces of blood vessels and organs.

Necessary background in biology: In biology, understanding the olfactory system is crucial. The olfactory system involves the detection of odors and scents and is closely related to the sense of smell. It includes specialized chemoreceptor cells located in the nasal cavity that detect different odorous molecules. These cells then send signals to the brain for further processing.

## Question ##

Subject: algebra
Principle: Follow the following principles:
1. Simplify the equation first by combining like terms and simplifying expressions.
2. Eliminate fractions by multiplying every term by the least common denominator (LCD).
Isolate the variable on one side of the equation by adding, subtracting, dividing, or multiplying both sides by a constant.
3. Maintain equality by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.
4. Check for multiple solutions or no solution, recognizing cases where the equation has no solution or infinitely many solutions.
5. Use clear notation to indicate operations and changes made at each step.
6. Check your solution by substituting it back into the original equation to verify it satisfies the equation.
7. State assumptions explicitly, such as assuming a variable represents a real number.
8. Provide step-by-step explanations for each step taken to solve the equation.
9. Highlight key learning points after solving, summarizing important techniques or strategies used.

## Example ##
## Question ##
If the equation of a line is y = 3x + 5, what is the value of y when x = 2?

## Answer ##
To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:
Substitute the given value into the equation: You are given the equation of a line as y = 3x + 5 and asked to find the value of y when x is 2.

Substitute the value of x: Given the equation y = 3x + 5, replace x with 2. This gives us y = 3(2) + 5.

Apply algebraic operations: After substitution, calculate the multiplication and addition. This means you first multiply 3 by 2, which gives 6, and then add 5 to this result.

Simplify the expression: Add the numbers together to find the value of y. This involves adding 6 (from step 2) to 5.

## Question ##
Solve for x: 4x−7(2−x)=3x+2
## Answer ##
1. Apply the distributive property: First, distribute -7 across (2 - x), which gives you 4x - 14 + 7x (because -7 multiplied by -x is +7x).

2. Combine like terms on both sides: On the left side of the equation, combine 4x and 7x to get 11x - 14. The right side remains 3x + 2.

3. Move all x terms to one side and constants to the other: To isolate x, subtract 3x from both sides to get all x terms on one side. This gives you 11x - 3x = 2 + 14. Simplify this to get 8x = 16.

Solve for x: Once all x terms are on one side and all constant terms are on the other, you can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient in front of x.
